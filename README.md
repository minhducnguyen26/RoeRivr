# About
This project involves creating a clone of the Amazon website using real-world dataset from 2020. The website will be built using React on the frontend and a Python server on the backend. The aim is to replicate the features and functionality of the Amazon website, including product listings, reviews, shopping cart, and checkout.

The real-world dataset from 2020 will provide the product information, reviews, and user data needed to populate the website. The React frontend will provide the user interface, allowing users to browse products, read reviews, add items to their shopping cart, and complete the checkout process. The Python server will handle the backend operations, such as querying the dataset, processing user requests, and handling payment transactions.

This project provides an opportunity to develop a real-world web application using modern web development technologies. It also involves working with a large and complex dataset, which requires data processing and management skills. By replicating the features and functionality of the Amazon website, the project aims to provide a realistic and challenging web development experience.

# Details
There are three datasets in the directory ./database/datasets/:

-   amazon_dataset.csv
-   best_sellers_dataset.csv
-   users_dataset.csv

But since each of the file contains > 10K rows, they are all ignored when saved to GitHub.
